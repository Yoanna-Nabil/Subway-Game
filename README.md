Subway Game using html, css and javascript.

The Subway Game is an interactive web-based project that simulates the experience of navigating through a subway system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to explore a virtual subway network, make decisions about routes and destinations, and experience the challenges and excitement of a subway journey.

HTML provides the structural framework for the Subway Game. It defines the layout and elements necessary to create the subway map and user interface. HTML tags like <div>, <ul>, and <li> are used to create sections, lists, and interactive elements such as buttons or dropdown menus. The subway map itself can be represented using HTML elements like <canvas> or a combination of HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing representation of the subway network.

CSS is utilized to style and enhance the visual appearance of the game. It allows for customization of colors, fonts, backgrounds, and other design elements. CSS properties like background-image, color, font-size, and border-radius can be applied to create an immersive and visually appealing subway environment. CSS can also be used to create animations or transitions to provide a more engaging user experience.

JavaScript is responsible for the game logic and interactivity. It enables users to make decisions, select routes, and simulate the movement of subway trains. JavaScript functions are used to handle user input, track the user's progress, calculate distances, and determine the optimal routes. It also allows for the dynamic updating of the subway map and provides feedback to the user, such as displaying arrival times or notifying about delays or closures.

The Subway Game can be customized to simulate various subway systems from different cities around the world. The subway map can be designed to include multiple lines, stations, and connections, offering users a realistic and immersive experience. Additional features such as time constraints, random events, or scoring systems can be implemented to add complexity and challenge to the game.

Overall, the Subway Game demonstrates the capabilities of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in creating an interactive and immersive subway simulation. It provides users with a fun and engaging experience, allowing them to navigate through a virtual subway network and test their decision-making skills while enjoying the thrill of a subway adventure.
